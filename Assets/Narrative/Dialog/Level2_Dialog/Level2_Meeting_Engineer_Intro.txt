/* 
	Level 2 scene, Meet the Engineer
	The prisoner has made his way to the center of the Engineering section
	Here he meets an engineer who's too afraid to go on alone.
	Taking him will take us to the crew's quarters.
	Leaving him, we have to brave the pistons and moving parts above to 
	cross over to the Science section
	The engineer suggests an alternative though...
