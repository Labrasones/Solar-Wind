	### Level 1-1, computer scene ###

	In this scene, our prisoner has just
	been freed and has wandered about the prison
	area for a while. He has have met no people
	yet, but a lone computer terminal waits
	in the Warden's office, the warden 
	nowhere to be found. The computer informs
	the prisoner that the ship is about to explode
	and there is an override sequence that can be
	input from the Captain's terminal on the
	bridge. The clock's ticking.
